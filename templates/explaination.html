    <h1>How it predicts</h1>
    <p class="paragraph">Machine learning is a powerful tool to find patterns of many kinds of fields such as images, signals, and
      bioinformatics. We are also seeing that it can apply to sports in recent years. Marathon's split times are one of
      the common patterns for us. Overall, runners run splits at the same pace, and it is not a difficult task to
      predict the finish time.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      However, it is hard to keep running at the same speed because of some conditions such as the weather, runners'
      experience, how rivals run, etc. Though we can't forecast the exact finish time, we can do with a range of
      estimates because there exist common patterns of split times. You don't have to input conditions except for your
      splits. Instead, I trained a machine learning model with past marathons' public records to detect the typical
      paces of each runner.
